@SonicsFan20 also holy sh we traded Smoak and got WORSE at 1B? How the blue hell did that happen?

@SonicsFan20 he's been fine this year it's the future I am concerned with
@SonicsFan20 and all the high IBP players play in OAK
@SonicsFan20 we tried that early on &amp; it failed so miserably. With no legit bats there's no one to fear. Problem is hes overcorrected
